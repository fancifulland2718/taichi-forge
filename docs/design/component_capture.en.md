# Component capture compiler: initial implementation

`taichi_forge.aot._component` is an internal producer-side API. It compiles the
original decorated method through the normal AST transformer; it does not parse
the application a second time or create a numerical wrapper.

`Component` declarations describe the owner's attributes. `RuntimeValue` supports
scalar and fixed vector/matrix values, `Array` currently supports scalar Ndarray,
and `StaticValue` accepts immutable scalar/tuple configuration. Entry arguments
currently support scalar and fixed vector/matrix values. The public SDK API is
not frozen.

The component environment and each entry's ABI are separate. Attribute accesses,
including those inside inline `ti.func`, append only used captures to the native
callable. `finalize_params()` runs after this single frontend traversal; argument
initialization still ends before the numerical body. First-use order determines
the physical projection and is recorded in `contract["captures"]`. Unused
independent declarations never become parameters or code dependencies.

The candidate cache checks used declaration schemas, static values, and referenced
numerical definitions. Dynamic values and owner identity do not specialize code.
`semantic_key` identifies the frontend definition/ABI projection; the existing
native compile contract additionally keys target capabilities and effective
compiler settings. Code objects retain dependency facts, not the producer owner.
They bind actual values through the existing launch context on each invocation.
Ordinary JIT keeps its original specialization path.

Frontend definitions are published only after capture validation succeeds.
Backend compilation remains lazy and uses the existing native cache. Uncontrolled
Python captures/calls, dynamic values in `ti.static`, and unqualified `real_func`
are rejected. Inline IR reuse and automatic real-function promotion are disabled
only in this deployment path until their capture contracts are qualified.

`tests/python/test_aot_component_capture.py` covers single lowering/backend compile
across owners and sizes, unused declarations, static/helper changes, conditional
capture use, ordinary Field JIT numerical comparison, owner release, failure
recovery and Runtime retirement.

This is not yet a deployed component SDK. Dense Fields use `DenseField`
declarations, not `Array`. `Dimension` distinguishes positive extents from active
counts, which may be zero and may reference an extent as their capacity bound.
Relations come from declarations, never from equal producer integer values.

The native `DenseSNodeSchema` is the next layout building block. It records the
original root/dense/place construction and scalar placement order, replacing only
explicitly identified dense axes with dimension parameters. It stores no live
node IDs, producer offsets, addresses or model values. Serialization uses the
existing native type/JSON contracts. The first layout family excludes nested
dense, sparse, quantized, Morton, index-offset and ambient layouts.

Instantiation calls the original `SNode::dense`/`insert_children` constructors,
then `Program::add_snode_tree` invokes the existing backend StructCompiler and
allocator. On CPU/CUDA, the original LLVM types and target DataLayout determine
all byte sizes and offsets. There is no Python padding calculator. The schema
validates version, placement order, required dimensions and positive i32 index
products before allocating a tree.

`test_dense_snode_schema.py` compares every actual compiled node's type, shape,
cell size and offset to ordinary FieldsBuilder at previously unseen extents.
It includes scalar, vector, matrix and rank-zero placements, and validates that
rejected bindings do not leave active tree instances.

Original `self.field` captures now retain the complete root schema and member
paths. Sibling blocks require declared dimension provenance; logical groups
cannot split or merge physical roots. Attribute aliases of the same member share
one physical parameter. Calls bind existing zero-copy Field views, retaining the
original root, offsets and owner. They neither copy members into independent
Ndarrays nor mutate module root pointers. This first slice requires qualified
compact members while preserving the full root in the schema.

`test_aot_component_dense.py` compares the same numerical definition with ordinary
JIT on CPU/CUDA. It covers new capacities, range/Field-shape/full-Field iteration,
vector/matrix elements, aliases, empty active ranges and capacity-tail sentinels.
Different sizes share one frontend definition and one native compilation; invalid
dimension/root bindings fail before execution.

The standalone Runtime now provides experimental
`dense_snode_group(schema_json, dimensions)`. It reconstructs actual SNodes with
the same schema, then invokes `StructCompilerLLVM::run_layout`, extracted from
and also used by ordinary JIT layout compilation. Queries project actual compiled
nodes; consumers do not supply offsets/strides. The complete simple dense root
is allocated once and zeroed through the LLVM allocator. Numerical addressing
uses arguments, without registering or switching fixed module root pointers.

`group.member(paths, dtype, element_shape=...)` validates root-relative place
paths, element types and compact layout, returning finite views of that root.
Paths will come from compiler-produced contracts, not application per-kernel
field tables. Groups reuse existing memory handles, borrowed leases and prepared
retirement. Closing is currently cold: wait, revoke all aliases, then release
storage. Other groups remain valid; revoked view handles remain closeable.

`test_aot_dense_snode_group.py` compares new-size layouts with ordinary SNodes
and covers scalar/vector/matrix/rank-zero transfers, aliasing, wrong Runtime,
invalid dimensions, and two groups used by loaded Kernel preparations with
interleaved execution and retirement. This qualifies simple dense storage and
its actual standalone calling path, not the full component instance contract,
nonblocking retirement or capture replacement.

Automatic Graph/component export, frozen TCM consumption of original Field
captures, real GeoPhys RNE and full instance lifetimes remain work in progress.
Producer Field calls still perform validation outside cold preparation. No
runtime performance or complete SDK qualification is claimed.
